# electron-react-quickstart
Boilerplate for an Electron App with React + Hot Loading

This project aims to be an alternative to boilerplates with a large footprint and many dependencies. 

**The goal is to keep it as simple as possible!**

Based on this guide:

Example for connection between main process and renderer process can be found in src/services/Electron.js

A lot of code was taken from these repos:

[electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/)

[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Both are licensed as MIT as well as this repository.

Huge thanks to the developers of these repos which made this repo possible!
